# Leet.js
> Leetcode solution in javascript. Test each problem using mocha.

### About

I use es6 syntax to write all test cases with mocha. Also, for fast building test cases of data structures such as linked list and binary tree, I wrote some utility classes for help.

**Directory Explaination**

```sh
leet.js
  ├── __test__ # mocha test case files
  ├── lib      # utilities
  └── src      # problem solutions
```

### Test

Simply test all problems

```
npm test
```

or test single problem

```
mocha __test__/`problem-name`.test.js
```
